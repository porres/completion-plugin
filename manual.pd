#X text 382 154 The best practice is to use [declare] in your patch so you do not need to worry about prefixes. Also \, some externals (like 'zexy') are a single binary that do not take a library prefix., f 55;
#X text 382 206 You may want to use a prefix if you have two externals with the same name from different libraries \, like [ceammc/xfade~] and [else/xafde~]. Nonetheless \, you can also just add the prefix yourself after you added the object \, so this option is better left as in the default setting., f 55;

#X text 382 66 - The checkbox to "include library prefix" \, if checked \, includes the library name as a prefix when you choose an external. By default this is not checked. With the default setting \, if you have Cyclone \, you can get the suggestion to add "cyclone/coll" and if you choose it then only [coll] is created. If you have the checkbox \, then [cyclone/coll] is created instead., f 55;
#X text 382 413 - Clicking on 'Save settings' saves the settings for the next time you open Pd. If you restore to the factory default it is also saved for the next time you open Pd., f 56;
#X text 480 577 Check the completion-plugin reamde for more details., f 28;
#X text 20 401 There is an extra search mode called "skipping" \, which requires you to start the search with "." (a period). If you type ".mfn" and the hotkey it searches anything that contains the 'm' \, 'f' and 'n' letters in that order. This gives you [makefilename] \, for instance., f 54;
#X text 20 326 Use up/down arrow keys to navigate through suggested selections and press enter to choose it. The object selection is highlighted with a selection color that you can choose in preferences as well. Alternatively you can just click with the left mouse button onto a suggested object name., f 54;
#X text 26 90 - The plugin scans the "Externals Instal Directory" (a.k.a. "pd_docsdir") set in "Path->Preferences" and its containing folders for help files in order to find externals to suggest. Note that the library name is included as a prefix so you know where the external comes from. The plugin also has a list of internal objects that do not come with a prefix (of course). You can also define your own suggestions in any .txt inside the folder "custom_completions". If you don't have "pd_docsdir" set \, a deeper (and not recomended) scan happens in all search paths in Pd \, which includes duplicates., f 54;
#X text 382 286 - You can set the hotkey (default ALT_L). This requires you to save and restart the plugin in order for this change to take effect. You can also create a hotkey that combines more than one key as the shortcut. For instance \, if you type "control+space" then you need to press "control" key plus "spacebar"., f 55;
#X text 382 367 - Clicking on 'Restore factory settings' restores back to the original settings., f 55;
#X text 382 468 - You can click on 'Rescan externals' to rescan for externals \, do this if you installed a new library and don't want to restart Pd., f 56;
