#X text 376 189 The best practice is to use [declare] in your patch so you do not need to worry about prefixes. Also \, some externals (like 'zexy') are a single binary that do not take a library prefix., f 56;

#X text 376 446 - Clicking on 'Save settings' saves the settings for the next time you open Pd. If you restore to the factory default it is also saved for the next time you open Pd., f 56;
#X text 20 401 There is an extra search mode called "skipping" \, which requires you to start the search with "." (a period). If you type ".mfn" and the hotkey it searches anything that contains the 'm' \, 'f' and 'n' letters in that order. This gives you [makefilename] \, for instance., f 54;
#X text 20 326 Use up/down arrow keys to navigate through suggested selections and press enter to choose it. The object selection is highlighted with a selection color that you can choose in preferences as well. Alternatively you can just click with the left mouse button onto a suggested object name., f 54;
#X text 376 345 - You can set the hotkey (default ALT_L). This requires you to save and restart the plugin in order for this change to take effect. You can also create a hotkey that combines more than one key as the shortcut. For instance \, if you type "control+space" then you need to press "control" key plus "spacebar"., f 56;
#X text 376 417 - Clicking on 'Restore factory settings' restores back to the original settings., f 56;
#X text 376 486 - You can click on 'Rescan externals' to rescan for externals \, do this if you installed a new library and don't want to restart Pd., f 56;

#X text 376 118 When you select the object \, you can press the shift key \, which includes the library name as a prefix. So \, if you have Cyclone \, you can be suggested [cyclone/coll]. If you choose it \, just [coll] is created \, but if you press shift then [cyclone/coll] is created., f 56;
#X text 376 240 You may want to use a prefix if you have two externals with the same name from different libraries \, like [ceammc/xfade~] and [else/xafde~]. Nonetheless \, you can also just add the prefix yourself after you added the object., f 56;
#X text 23 90 - The plugin scans for externals in all usual places like the ones set in "Path->Preferences" and its containing folders. The search looks for help files in order to find externals to suggest. Note that the library name is included as a prefix so you know where the external comes from. The plugin also has a list of internal objects that do not come with a prefix (of course). You can also define your own suggestions in any .txt inside the folder "custom_completions"., f 54;
