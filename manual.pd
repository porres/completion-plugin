#X text 382 154 The best practice is to use [declare] in your patch so you do not need to worry about prefixes. Also \, some externals (like 'zexy') are a single binary that do not take a library prefix., f 55;
#X text 382 206 You may want to use a prefix if you have two externals with the same name from different libraries \, like [ceammc/xfade~] and [else/xafde~]. Nonetheless \, you can also just add the prefix yourself after you added the object \, so this option is better left as in the default setting., f 55;

#X text 382 66 - The checkbox to "include library prefix" \, if checked \, includes the library name as a prefix when you choose an external. By default this is not checked. With the default setting \, if you have Cyclone \, you can get the suggestion to add "cyclone/coll" and if you choose it then only [coll] is created. If you have the checkbox \, then [cyclone/coll] is created instead., f 55;

#X text 20 94 - The plugin scans the "Externals Instal Directory" set in "Path->Preferences" and its containing folders for help files in order to find externals to suggest. Note that the library name is included as a prefix so you know where the external comes from. The plugin also has a list of internal objects that do not come with a prefix (of course). You can also define your own suggestions in any .txt inside the folder "custom_completions"., f 54;
#X text 399 607 Check the completion-plugin reamde for more details.;
#X text 20 297 Use up/down arrow keys to navigate through suggested selections (use shift+arrows for faster navigation) and click with the left mouse button or press enter to choose it. The object selection is highlighted with a selection color that you can choose in preferences as well., f 54;
#X text 20 372 There is an extra search mode called "skipping" \, which requires you to start the search with "." (a period). If you type ".mfn" and the hotkey it searches anything that contains the 'm' \, 'f' and 'n' letters in that order. This gives you [makefilename] \, for instance., f 54;
